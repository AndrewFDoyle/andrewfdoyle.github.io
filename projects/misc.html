        <h3 class="section-header">Christmas 2022 Crafts</h3>
          <p>
            In 2022, I had a few friends contribute to me in ways I wanted to thank them for at the end of the year. I dcided to try my hand at making handmade gifts. This included a Dice tower for my friend who makes games. A pencil holder, themed to resemble a cabin, had moved to Tenesee recently at the time. the model reactor was for a friend who assisted in some writing for <a href="../projects/blog.html">the blog</a>.
          </p>
          <h4>Dice Tower</h4>
          <p>For those who don't know (like I didn't), a dice tower is a piece for games that use dice rolls to do the roll in a contained area. the original concept for tower had a few iterations before reaching final form.</p>

            To learn how to edit the gcode and "wind back" the print to the correct layer height using <a href="https://youtu.be/kwywIc7wUn4?si=_IsS0UBHdENRvFgr">this tutorial</a>.

          <p>This is about the layer where the part failed which was about 13/64ths of an inch. From this instruction, you can see the highlighted text starting with "G28" which was where I copied to get the print head to return back so I could then instruct it to return to the correct height, but not ontinue with the initial steps.</p>
          <p>Once the print completed. I made a coat of primer to make sure to prep the surface.</p>

          <p>This gets completed in the image at the top of this screen of this page. I have a demo of this<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/rkWki3sgETg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
          <h4>Pencil Holder</h4>
            <p>Making something that would need to be a keep other things in it required making sure it wouldn't tip if someone didn't balance it. If I did this in a future version, I would make sure to add something to weight the base better and cover it with a high friction surface.</p>

          <h4>Model Nuclear Reactor</h4>
          <p>I made a small reactor inspired by <a href="https://www.rsec.psu.edu/History.aspx">this reactor</a> and the main features are the truss structure frame, the reactor core, the internal light to simulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation">Cherenkov radiation</a>, and the water made from resin.</p>

          </div>
          <p>I made a demo <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/czLSVmSQbk8" target="_blank">here.</a> Unfortunately, I didn't really know how to handle the resin well and I tried to remove some of the excess bubbles by bathing it in hot water and they were too deep to release before it fully cured.</p>
        <h3 class="section-header">Grill Prep Table</h3>
          <p>
            This is something I made for my dad in 2021 which was really my first "big" project in woodworking. I had made smaller items before, but nothing where I had made a frame that would be used for shelving. It's now the side table for the grill and a holder of garden equipment. Oiringally, I had planned to select a dark stain, but since I used a mix of Cedar for the siding and a treated lumber frame, it already had a natural weather proofing and I decided against adding anything to finish.
