          <p>
            In April 2021, I took the mechanical fundamentals of engineering exam and passed and I registered with the NCEES after the necessary checks to obtain an EIT (number ET030017).

        <h3 class="section-header">Google Data Analytics Certificate.</h3>
          <p>
            This is something I completed between the end of 2021. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics" target="_blank">for this course</a> which gave <a href="../media/page-content/datacert.pdf">this certificate</a>. If you are interested in getting your foot in the door for any data-oriented career and you have no prior experience, I would personally recommend 1. finding a problem area or project you would really like to tackle and learn with that. 2. find a "good enough" tool set to use and stick with it for your needs and 3. spend a lot of time learning about the data acquisition, cleaning data, and some on data presentation which is really visual rhetoric. If you plan to use the Microsoft ecosystem, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query" target="_blank">Power Query</a> is a good tool which is likely available in most work environments. Where languages like Python Pandas may offer tools that may be quicker, they are not as typical.

        <h3 class="section-header">Lean Yellow Belt</h3>
          <p>In our office, a main task of our department relied on a number of trackers that needed all manual input which would consist of data like dates, names, pending action, and notes adding to 10+ columns of data to enter. The entries would take time, may contain errors, and need to regularly remove and add new tasks. As of Spring 2023, a daily report of pending tasks became available to us which enabled us to remove a number of those steps, taking advantage of Power Query, which reduced the remaining entries to a series of "Yes / No" answers given on columns with data validation. This improves accuracy, reducing entry time and overall effort.</p>
